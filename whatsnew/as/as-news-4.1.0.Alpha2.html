			<p><b>Increased support for product server runtimes</b></p>
		</td>
        <td align="top">
	  <p>
	  
	  Support has been increased for AS 7.1+ and it's derived
	  products and it now supports the notion of a product slot
	  instead of an hard coded EAP slot.</p>
	  <p>
	  This should mean EAP, SOA-P etc. should be identified and
	  started correctly as long as they do not require custom
	  handling outside of what AS 7 need.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  If the server cannot be fully identified the tools will try
	  what it can to fallback to ensure the server can be used.
	  	</p>
			<p>
				Also, support for previous and current versions of GateIn have been added. 
				This ensures that GateIn receives the same level of support that you've come to 
				expect from our other server adapters. Specifically, support for GateIn servers versions 3.3.0 , 3.4.0, and 3.5.0 has been added and tested.
