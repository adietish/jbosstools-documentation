			  <p>If you have typed in a bad host name or
			 your <tt>~/.openshift/express.conf</tt>
			 settings were wrong you would get an "Invalid
			 credentials" error instead of information on
			 the host not being reachable. This is now
			 fixed.</p>

			  <p>Releated to this was that rhc tools
			  version 1.4.7 generated a different format
			  for host in <tt>express.conf</tt> which
			  caused the tools to parse the host
			  wrongly and you thus got the "Invalid
			  credentials" error. JBoss Tools have been fixed to
			  handle this new format but newer version of
			  rhc tools have also been fixed to use the
			  previous format making both old and new
			  tools compatible again.</p>

				Historically OpenShift did not allow users to users to use a mysql and a Postgres database at the same time. 
				This restriction was lifted some weeks ago and we now upgraded the tooling to allow that, too.

			<p>The OpenShift server adpter keeps track of
			your local changes and tells you if there are
			any that you can publish to OpenShift.</p>
			  
			<p>Previously this tracking was only done
			  against 'origin' remote and only tracking if
			  there were changes to previously committed
			  files that had not been pushed yet.</p>

			  <p>This meant the dialog could be
			  misleading/unprecise to the user.</p>
			  
			  <p>Now OpenShift Tools will check against the
			  proper remote (in case it is not 'origin')
			  and do a fetch do be able to do a proper
			  check if there really are changes locally
			  compared to what is on the remote
			  OpenShift.</p>
